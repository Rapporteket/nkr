# Install
The current package can be fetched directly from your Rstudio session. If not already
present, first install the devtools-package from your R terminal:

  install.packages("devtools")

Then, install the rapbase package:

  devtools::install_github("Rapporteket/rapbase")

When installed at Rapporteket make sure clean-up is performed:

  devtools::install_github("Rapporteket/rapbase", args=c("--clean"))

This will add local configuration after the package has been installed


NOTE: Communicating through a proxy might cause the above install command to
fail.
